# Mission-to-Mars

Module 10

# Overview

The following analysis is regarind the web application created for Mars' information.  Initially provided were Mars' news and an image and added was information regarding Mars' hemisphers and images to go along with it. The webpage was subsequently formatted as well to enhance viewing.

# Results
Mars hemisphere images and titles were scraped and rendered on the webpage.  There were four images that were added.  Also added were bolded fonts, underline fonts and a highlighted heading.

# Summary
The Deliverable 1 and Deliverable 2 requirements were challenging for this module. Deliverable 1's request to loop through the dictionary was the initial hindrance. Deliverable 2's request to add all four images was a second hindrance. I obtained assistance from BCS to ensure that the deliverables were provided. Overall, I found this Module to be interesting however some of the components were very challenging as presented in the Challenge.
